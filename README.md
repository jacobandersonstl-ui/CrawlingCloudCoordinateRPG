A corrdinate based game built for Pyhton version 3.13 (No older) where you have one goal: Make it out of the forest in exactly 12 moves.

As previously stated, in order to run this game, you need at least Pyhton 3.13. This is because I want to ensure stability for everyone (By that I mean no errors accross versions).

System requirements:

Pyhton 3.13+

A Computer :D
